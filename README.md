# Basecamp notifications for Omarchy

A Quickshell bar plugin that shows notifications from all Basecamp accounts available through the [Basecamp CLI](https://github.com/basecamp/basecamp-cli).

## Features

- Discovers every authorized Basecamp account automatically.
- Shows unread notifications by default.
- Combines notifications from all accounts in newest-first order.
- Filters notifications by account or between unread and all items.
- Uses notification-type icons for comments, mentions, chats, events, completions, documents, bulletins, hills, and boosts.
- Opens notifications in Basecamp and marks unread items as read.
- Dismisses an unread notification from its count badge without opening it.
- Changes the bar logo color when unread notifications exist.
- Shares unread state, account filter, and unread/previous tab across every monitor. Each bar still opens and closes on its own.
- Polls every 10 minutes from one shared service. Right-click or middle-click the bar logo to refresh immediately.

## Requirements

- Omarchy with Quickshell plugin support.
- [Basecamp CLI](https://github.com/basecamp/basecamp-cli) 0.9 or newer.
- A full-access Basecamp CLI login. Version 0.9 and newer requests full access by default; read-only logins can view notifications but cannot mark them as read.

Install the Basecamp CLI on Omarchy:

```bash
omarchy pkg add basecamp-cli
```

Authenticate and confirm that the CLI can see your accounts:

```bash
basecamp auth login
basecamp accounts list
basecamp notifications list
```

The plugin uses the CLI's existing credential store. It does not read, copy, or store Basecamp access tokens.

## Installation

Install and enable the plugin with:

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy-basecamp-plugin.git --enable
```

Choose the right bar section if Omarchy asks for a placement. The plugin manifest also declares the right section as its default.

For a local checkout, pass its path instead:

```bash
omarchy plugin add ~/code/basecamp/omarchy-basecamp-plugin --enable
```

If the plugin ID is already installed, remove the existing copy first or use a separate test user. Omarchy will not overwrite an installed plugin.

## Usage

- Left-click the Basecamp logo to open or close the panel.
- Right-click or middle-click the logo to refresh.
- Select an account to filter the combined feed.
- Select `Unread` or `Previous notifications` below the Basecamp title.
- Click a notification to open it and close the panel. Unread notifications are also marked as read.
- Hover the unread count on a notification to reveal a dismiss control. Click it to mark the item as read without opening it or closing the panel.
- Use the up and down arrow keys to move through notifications.
- Use the left and right arrow keys to move through account filters.
- Press `U` for unread notifications, `P` for previous notifications, or `R` to refresh.

## Development

Run the model, demo-contract, and QML service tests with:

```bash
./tests/run
```

### Demo data

Launch the current checkout with fictional accounts and notifications:

```bash
./demo/run
```

The demo uses an empty workspace and temporarily shows only the Basecamp widget on the right side of the bar. Press `Ctrl+C` to restore the normal shell, plugin installation, bar layout, and previous workspace.

Create a clean screenshot cropped to the top bar and open panel with:

```bash
./demo/run --screenshot
```

The screenshot is saved in `~/Pictures`. Choose a destination explicitly when useful:

```bash
./demo/run --screenshot --output /tmp/basecamp-demo.png
```

Demo mode runs the plugin against `demo/bin/basecamp`, which implements the same CLI commands used in production. It never reads Basecamp credentials or contacts Basecamp. Mark-as-read actions are kept in temporary session state and disappear when the demo exits.

## Updates

Git-managed installations can be updated with:

```bash
omarchy plugin update 37signals.basecamp
```

## Removal

Remove the plugin with:

```bash
omarchy plugin remove 37signals.basecamp
```

Removing the plugin does not remove the Basecamp CLI or change its stored accounts and credentials.

## Privacy and security

The plugin runs these local CLI commands:

```text
basecamp version
basecamp auth status --json
basecamp accounts list --json
basecamp notifications list --account <account-id> --json
basecamp notifications read <notification-id> --account <account-id> --json
```

Notification data is held in the Quickshell process memory. The plugin does not write notification content, account details, credentials, or tokens to disk.
